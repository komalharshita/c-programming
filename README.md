# C Programming ‚Äî &nbsp;

A curated collection of C programs and learning resources.  
This repository is organized topicwise as I continue learning more about C programming. 
---
## üìö What this repo contains
- Compact, well-commented C programs that demonstrate core concepts.
- Small practice problems and mini-projects.
- `README.md` guidance for each topic folder.
- Helpful compiler flags, a sample `Makefile`, and contribution guidelines.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites
- A C compiler (GCC recommended) installed:
  - Linux / macOS: `gcc`
  - Windows: use MinGW or WSL
- Optional: `make` for automation
- Optional: `valgrind` for memory checks (Linux/macOS)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compile and run (single file)
To compile and run a single `.c` file:

```bash
# compile
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -g file.c -o file

# run
./file
```
